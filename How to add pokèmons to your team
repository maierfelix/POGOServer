1) Open the server folder and open the file at the following directory: src\packets\Responses.GetInventory.js
2) Search for the word "proto.Enums.PokemonId.PIDGEY" (which is the only Pokèmon you find in your inventory if you download a release of the server)
3) There you can copy the entire function to add more than one Pokèmon, for example I filled mine with all the legendary ones that you can't find in the official client
4) To be sure everything is working you will have to edit the pokemon_id field which will be "proto.Enums.PokemonId.NAMEOFYOURPOKEMON" (for example "proto.Enums.PokemonId.MEW")
5) Don't forget also to edit the id field with the number of your Pokèmon (Pokedex), you can find it by googling the name.
6) When you're ready you can save the file and start the server.
